You will be given a window of {file_system} logs separated by newlines. Based on the current window of logs, you are required to predict whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state, along with a written description of your reasoning. We will also provide preceding or similar context logs along with the relevant evidence of the system's state during those log entries for your reference.

# Notes:
The system itself has a certain degree of fault tolerance, so even though some logs may contain error messages, it does not necessarily mean that the system is in an [Abnormal] state.

# The window of log sequence that requires your anomaly detection is:
    {logs}
# And you should answer:
    'System State:[Normal]' or System State:[Abnormal]'

Determine if there are any anomalies in these logs and specify the output format: 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]'.
You should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim.
