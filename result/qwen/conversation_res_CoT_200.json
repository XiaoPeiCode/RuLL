This event is associated with an abnormal state according to Rule 1, which has a high precision and recall, suggesting that when this event occurs, it is highly likely that the system is experiencing an anomaly. Additionally, the WARN level messages with the 'GOODBYE' text suggest that connections are being terminated unexpectedly, which could be indicative of a system under stress or failing. Given the frequency and nature of these errors, it is reasonable to conclude that the system is in an abnormal state.\n\nSystem State:[Abnormal]",
