Therefore, the system state can be classified as [Abnormal].\n\nSystem State:[Abnormal]",

The repeated 'GOODBYE' messages suggest that multiple learners are disconnecting from the cluster, which could be indicative of a network issue or a problem with the learners themselves. The 'Unexpected exception causing shutdown while sock still open' errors further emphasize that there are critical issues happening within the system, potentially leading to data inconsistency or loss of quorum in the Zookeeper ensemble. Given the severity and frequency of these errors, the system state can be considered abnormal.\n\nSystem State:[Abnormal]",
