While these are not errors per se, they indicate potential instability in the network or communication layer of the system. However, since the guidelines suggest that the system has a certain degree of fault tolerance and we are looking for severe problems, the presence of warnings does not automatically classify the system state as abnormal. Without further evidence of critical failures or system-wide impacts, we cannot conclude that the system is in an abnormal state based solely on these logs.
