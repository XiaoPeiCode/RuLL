The system itself has a certain degree of fault tolerance, so even though some logs may contain error messages, it does not necessarily mean that the system is in an [Abnormal] state.\n2. A system in [Abnormal] state refers to a serious problem occurring within the system. For issues of lower severity, such as warnings, you should not classify them as exceptions.\n3.
