Based on the current window of logs, you are required to predict whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state, along with a written description of your reasoning.\n\n# Notes:\n1. The system itself has a certain degree of fault tolerance, so even though some logs may contain error messages, it does not necessarily mean that the system is in an [Abnormal] state.\n2. A system in [Abnormal] state refers to a serious problem occurring within the system. For issues of lower severity, such as warnings, you should not classify them as exceptions.\n3. You only need to determine if there are any severe exceptions in the current log sequence; you do not need to identify potential hidden exceptions.\n\n\n# Each log entry contains two parts:(Log event ID - Raw content). The window of log sequence that requires your anomaly detection is():\n    E3:generating core.172\n\tE3:generating core.174\n\tE3:generating core.236\n\tE3:generating core.237\n\tE3:generating core.238\n\tE3:generating core.173\n\tE3:generating core.228\n\tE3:generating core.164\n\tE3:generating core.229\n\tE3:generating core.165\n\n\n\n# The Guidelines for anomaly detection is :\n# The Guidelines for anomaly detection is : \nBased on the historical data, the log sequence is perfectly normal, unless it clearly contains system anomalies.\nThe provided guidelines are very reliable. You need to trust the guidelines I provide to you first, unless there is more obvious and direct evidence to the contrary.\n\n# And you should answer:\n    'System State:[Normal]' or System State:[Abnormal]'\n\nDetermine if there are any anomalies in these logs and specify the output format: 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]'.\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim.\n",
        "response": "The log entries consist of repeated instances of 'E3: generating core' followed by numbers. Since all the logs have the same event identifier (E3), and there is no indication of error codes or messages that would suggest a severe issue, we can assume that this behavior is normal according to the guidelines provided. The repetition of similar log events does not indicate an abnormal state without further context suggesting otherwise.\n\nSystem State:[Normal]",
