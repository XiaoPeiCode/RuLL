        "response": "Based on the provided log entries, all logs belong to the same event type E20:KERNDTLB, which indicates RAS KERNEL FATAL data TLB error interrupts. According to Rule 1, if E20 is present, then the target is 1, which implies an abnormal state. Given the high precision of this rule (1.0), it is reliable to conclude that the presence of E20 logs signifies an abnormal condition, despite its lower recall rate. Since all logs in the window fall under this category, it is indicative of an ongoing critical issue related to kernel data TLB errors.\n\nSystem State:[Abnormal]",
