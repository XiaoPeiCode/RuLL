Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., IDs, sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns.\n- **Typical Lifecycle**: A typical operation in the system goes through several stages in a defined sequence. Key stages include allocation, reception, processing, serving, and removal. Missing key steps within the normal operational flow could indicate an abnormal state.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details.

Based on the provided log sequences and any previous rules, summarize new rules that can help in anomaly detection. **When answering, please also check whether the previous rules are still appropriate.

Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., IDs, sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns.\n- **Typical Lifecycle**: A typical operation in the system goes through several stages in a defined sequence. Key stages include allocation, reception, processing, serving, and removal. Missing key steps within the normal operational flow could indicate an abnormal state.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\n**Complete List of Log Templates**:\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be given some sequences of log events along with labels indicating whether they are normal or abnormal.

Based on the provided log sequences and any previous rules, summarize new rules that can help in anomaly detection. **When answering, please also check whether the previous rules are still appropriate. Remove the ones that are not appropriate and include the appropriate ones in your answer.**\n\n**Important Instructions:**\n- Output **only** the JSON object specified in the output format.\n- Ensure all keys and string values in the JSON are enclosed in **double quotes**.\n- Do **not** include any explanations, reasoning, or text outside the JSON object.\n\nA rule is a pattern of log events leading to either [Normal] or [Abnormal] system states.\n\n## Background Information\n- **System Overview**: The system generates logs corresponding to specific operations or states. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., IDs, sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns.\n- **Typical Lifecycle**: A typical operation in the system goes through several stages in a defined sequence. Key stages include allocation, reception, processing, serving, and removal. Missing key steps within the normal operational flow could indicate an abnormal state.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\n**Complete List of Log Templates**:\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be given some sequences of log events along with labels indicating whether they are normal or abnormal.

Based on the provided log sequences and any previous rules, summarize new rules that can help in anomaly detection. **When answering, please also check whether the previous rules are still appropriate.

Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., IDs, sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns.\n- **Typical Lifecycle**: A typical operation in the system goes through several stages in a defined sequence. Key stages include allocation, reception, processing, serving, and removal. Missing key steps within the normal operational flow could indicate an abnormal state.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\n**Complete List of Log Templates**:\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be given some sequences of log events along with labels indicating whether they are normal or abnormal.
