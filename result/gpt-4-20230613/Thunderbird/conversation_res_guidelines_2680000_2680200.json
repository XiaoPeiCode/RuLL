Based on the current window of logs, you are required to predict whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state, along with a written description of your reasoning.\n\n# Notes:\n1. The system itself has a certain degree of fault tolerance, so even though some logs may contain error messages, it does not necessarily mean that the system is in an [Abnormal] state.\n2. A system in [Abnormal] state refers to a serious problem occurring within the system. For issues of lower severity, such as warnings, you should not classify them as exceptions.\n3. You only need to determine if there are any severe exceptions in the current log sequence; you do not need to identify potential hidden exceptions.\n4. The extracted guidelines are very reliable. You need to trust the guidelines I provide to you first, unless there is more obvious and direct evidence to the contrary.\n\n\n# Each log entry contains two parts:(Log event ID - Raw content).

        "response": "The logs contain multiple instances of event E706, which according to the provided guidelines, is associated with a high likelihood of system anomalies. The rule for E706 has a precision and recall of 0.9999, indicating that it is highly reliable and covers a large proportion of exceptions. Furthermore, the raw content of these E706 logs indicates a 'Fatal error (Local Catastrophic Error)', which suggests a serious problem with the system. Therefore, based on the high reliability of the rule for E706 and the severity of the error indicated in the logs, it can be concluded that the system is in an abnormal state.\n\nSystem State:[Abnormal]",
