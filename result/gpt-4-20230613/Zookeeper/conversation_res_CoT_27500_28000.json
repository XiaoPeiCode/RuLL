It might indicate that the system is losing connections to multiple nodes, which could potentially lead to an abnormal state if not addressed.\n\nHowever, without more context or information about the normal operation of the system, it's difficult to definitively say whether this is an anomaly or not. For instance, if these connections are expected to close at this time or if the system has a high degree of fault tolerance and can handle these connections closing without issue, then this could be normal behavior. On the other hand, if these connections are not expected to close and the system cannot handle this many connections closing at once, then this could be an anomaly.\n\nBased on the information provided, I would lean towards this being potentially abnormal behavior due to the multiple WARN messages in a short span of time.

Many systems are designed to handle such issues without going into an abnormal state. However, the broken connection could potentially lead to problems if it's not handled properly.\n\nIn this case, without additional context or logs, it's difficult to definitively say whether the system is in an abnormal state.
