However, it is important to note that the system itself has a certain degree of fault tolerance, so the presence of error messages does not necessarily indicate an abnormal state.\n\nAnalyzing the logs, we can see that there are two types of error messages present. The first type is related to the 'ib_sm_discovery.c' module, where the system failed to get node information due to no response. The second type is related to the 'ib_mad_dispatch' module, where the system failed to process a message for a specific port.\n\nWhile these error messages indicate some issues, they do not necessarily indicate a critical or abnormal state. The system may still be functioning properly despite these errors. It would be necessary to analyze more logs and consider additional factors to make a definitive determination of the system state.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided logs, the system state is: System State:[Normal]",

The second log (E60) indicates that the data_thread() function did not receive any answer from a Thunderbird_C3 datasource. While this may be an error, it does not necessarily indicate an abnormal state as the system may have alternative data sources or fallback mechanisms.\n\nThe third log (E17) indicates the start of a new sweep, which is a normal event in the system.
