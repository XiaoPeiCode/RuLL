However, the recall rate is 0.9562, indicating that there might be some exceptions that the rule does not cover.\n\nIn the given log sequence, we can observe multiple instances of log event E68, which confirms the presence of abnormal behavior. Therefore, based on the provided logs and the guideline, the system state is [Abnormal].\n\nSystem State: [Abnormal]",

The rule has a precision of 1.0, meaning that all instances of E68 are considered abnormal. However, the recall rate is 0.9562, indicating that there might be some instances of abnormality that are not captured by this rule.\n\nIn the given log sequence, we can observe multiple occurrences of E68, which confirms the presence of unexpected exceptions causing shutdown while the socket is still open. Therefore, based on the provided guideline and the presence of E68 logs, we can conclude that the system is in an abnormal state.\n\nSystem State: [Abnormal]",
