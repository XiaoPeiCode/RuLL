Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific Block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n\n- HDFS Overview: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- Log Templates: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\nHere is the complete list of log templates used in the system:\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1. Log Event Sequence Window: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E5', 'E5', 'E22', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E26', 'E4', 'E3', 'E4', 'E2', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E21', 'E21', 'E20']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   -Rule 1: If E20  sequentially in a log sequence, then the probability that the log sequence is an anomaly is 1.0.This rule has a precision of 1.0 \n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3. Result: Always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim to indicate your final decision.\n\n",

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific Block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n\n- HDFS Overview: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- Log Templates: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\nHere is the complete list of log templates used in the system:\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1. Log Event Sequence Window: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E5', 'E5', 'E22', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E26', 'E4', 'E3', 'E4', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E21', 'E28', 'E26', 'E21']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   -Rule 1: If E28  sequentially in a log sequence, then the probability that the log sequence is an anomaly is 0.9553072625698324.This rule has a precision of 0.9553072625698324 \n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3. Result: Always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim to indicate your final decision.\n\n",

Log Event Sequence Window: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E22', 'E5', 'E5', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E4', 'E4', 'E3', 'E2', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E21', 'E28', 'E26', 'E21']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   -Rule 1: If E28  sequentially in a log sequence, then the probability that the log sequence is an anomaly is 0.9553072625698324.This rule has a precision of 0.9553072625698324 \n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3. Result: Always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim to indicate your final decision.\n\n",

Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n\n- HDFS Overview: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- Log Templates: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details.

Log Event Sequence Window: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E22', 'E5', 'E7']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   -Rule 1: If E7  sequentially in a log sequence, then the probability that the log sequence is an anomaly is 1.0.This rule has a precision of 1.0 \n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3.

In this case, we have the log event 'E7' occurring after 'E5' and 'E22'. Therefore, the rule is triggered.\n\n- Since Rule 1 is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state.\n\n3.

The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E22', 'E5', 'E5', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E4', 'E3', 'E4', 'E2', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E20', 'E21', 'E21']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   -Rule 1: If E20  sequentially in a log sequence, then the probability that the log sequence is an anomaly is 1.0.This rule has a precision of 1.0 \n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3. Result: Always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim to indicate your final decision.\n\n",
        "response": "1. Follow the rule or not: I followed the anomaly detection rules provided.\n\nReasoning: The provided rule states that if log event E20 appears sequentially in the log sequence, then the probability that the log sequence is an anomaly is 1.0. Since the log sequence contains the log event E20, the rule is triggered, indicating a high probability of an abnormal system state.\n\n2. Reason: The log sequence contains the following log events: ['E5', 'E22', 'E5', 'E5', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E4', 'E3', 'E4', 'E2', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E20', 'E21', 'E21'].\n\nBased on the triggered rule, the presence of log event E20 indicates an abnormal system state. Additionally, we can observe the following patterns and anomalies in the log sequence:\n\n- Multiple occurrences of log event E5: This could indicate a potential issue with receiving blocks from a source.\n- Multiple occurrences of log event E9: This could indicate a potential issue with receiving blocks of different sizes from different sources.\n- Multiple occurrences of log event E11: This could indicate a potential issue with terminating packet responders for blocks.\n- Multiple occurrences of log event E26: This could indicate a potential issue with updating the block map and receiving addStoredBlock requests.\n- Log event E4 followed by log event E3: This indicates an exception while serving a block, which could be an abnormal state.\n- Log event E2: This indicates a successful verification, which is a normal state.\n\nConsidering the triggered rule and the observed patterns and anomalies, it is likely that the system is in an abnormal state.\n\n3.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific Block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n\n- HDFS Overview: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies.

To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details.

The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E5', 'E22', 'E7']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   -Rule 1: If E7  sequentially in a log sequence, then the probability that the log sequence is an anomaly is 1.0.This rule has a precision of 1.0 \n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific Block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n\n- HDFS Overview: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- Log Templates: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details.

If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1.

Log Event Sequence Window: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E5', 'E5', 'E22', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E25', 'E26', 'E5', 'E18', 'E16', 'E6', 'E26', 'E21', 'E3', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E21', 'E21']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   Based on the historical data,there are no macth rule. The log sequence is perfectly normal, unless it clearly contains system anomalies.\n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3. Result: Always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim to indicate your final decision.\n\n",

This indicates that the system is actively receiving blocks, which is a normal behavior in the HDFS file system.\n\nAdditionally, there are log events E9 and E26, which represent receiving a block of a certain size from a source and updating the block map, respectively. These events further confirm the normal operation of the system.\n\nThere are also log events E21 and E23, which represent deleting a block and adding it to the invalid set, respectively. These events indicate that the system is performing necessary maintenance tasks, which are expected in a normal state.\n\nBased on the absence of any anomaly detection rules and the normal behavior indicated by the log events, I conclude that the system is in a [Normal] state.\n\nSystem State: [Normal]",

Log Event Sequence Window: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E5', 'E22', 'E7']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   -Rule 1: If E7  sequentially in a log sequence, then the probability that the log sequence is an anomaly is 1.0.This rule has a precision of 1.0 \n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3. Result: Always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim to indicate your final decision.\n\n",

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific Block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n\n- HDFS Overview: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- Log Templates: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details.

If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific Block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n\n- HDFS Overview: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- Log Templates: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\nHere is the complete list of log templates used in the system:\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1.

The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E5', 'E22', 'E7']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   -Rule 1: If E7  sequentially in a log sequence, then the probability that the log sequence is an anomaly is 1.0.This rule has a precision of 1.0 \n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific Block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n\n- HDFS Overview: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- Log Templates: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\nHere is the complete list of log templates used in the system:\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1. Log Event Sequence Window: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E5', 'E22', 'E7']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   -Rule 1: If E7  sequentially in a log sequence, then the probability that the log sequence is an anomaly is 1.0.This rule has a precision of 1.0 \n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific Block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n\n- HDFS Overview: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- Log Templates: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details.

Log Event Sequence Window: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E22']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   Based on the historical data,there are no macth rule. The log sequence is perfectly normal, unless it clearly contains system anomalies.\n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3.

Log Event Sequence Window: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E22']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   Based on the historical data,there are no macth rule. The log sequence is perfectly normal, unless it clearly contains system anomalies.\n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3. Result: Always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim to indicate your final decision.\n\n",

Reason: Since there are no matching rules for the provided log sequence, I will analyze the log content for any potential issues. The log events in the sequence are 'E5' and 'E22'. \n\n- 'E5' represents the log template 'Receiving block [*] src:[*] dest:[*]'. This log event indicates that a block is being received from a source to a destination. Without any additional information or context, it is difficult to determine if this log event is abnormal.\n\n- 'E22' represents the log template 'BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]'. This log event indicates that a block is being allocated in the HDFS NameSystem. Again, without any additional information or context, it is difficult to determine if this log event is abnormal.\n\n3.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific Block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n\n- HDFS Overview: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- Log Templates: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details.

If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific Block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n\n- HDFS Overview: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific Block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n\n- HDFS Overview: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- Log Templates: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\nHere is the complete list of log templates used in the system:\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1. Log Event Sequence Window: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E5', 'E5', 'E22', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E26', 'E4', 'E4', 'E3', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E21', 'E21']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   Based on the historical data,there are no macth rule. The log sequence is perfectly normal, unless it clearly contains system anomalies.\n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3. Result: Always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim to indicate your final decision.\n\n",

Log Event Sequence Window: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E5', 'E5', 'E22', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E4', 'E3', 'E4', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E21', 'E21']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   Based on the historical data,there are no macth rule. The log sequence is perfectly normal, unless it clearly contains system anomalies.\n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3. Result: Always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim to indicate your final decision.\n\n",

The log sequence starts with three occurrences of 'E5', which represents receiving a block from a source. This is a normal operation in the HDFS system.\n2. 'E22' represents the allocation of a block, which is also a normal operation.\n3. 'E11' and 'E9' occur multiple times, indicating the termination and receiving of blocks. These are normal operations in the HDFS system.\n4. 'E26' represents the addition of a stored block, which is a normal operation.\n5. 'E4' and 'E3' represent exceptions and serving blocks, respectively. These are normal operations in the HDFS system.\n6. 'E23' represents the deletion of a block, which is a normal operation.\n7. 'E21' represents the deletion of a block file, which is also a normal operation.\n\nBased on the log sequence and the absence of any triggered rules, there are no indications of anomalies or abnormal system states.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific Block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n\n- HDFS Overview: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- Log Templates: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific Block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n\n- HDFS Overview: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- Log Templates: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\nHere is the complete list of log templates used in the system:\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1.

The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E22', 'E5', 'E5', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E26', 'E4', 'E3', 'E4', 'E2', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E21', 'E21']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   Based on the historical data,there are no macth rule. The log sequence is perfectly normal, unless it clearly contains system anomalies.\n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific Block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n\n- HDFS Overview: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- Log Templates: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\nHere is the complete list of log templates used in the system:\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1.

The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E5', 'E22', 'E5', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E26', 'E4', 'E3', 'E4', 'E2', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E21', 'E21']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   Based on the historical data,there are no macth rule. The log sequence is perfectly normal, unless it clearly contains system anomalies.\n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2.

It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- Log Templates: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\nHere is the complete list of log templates used in the system:\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1. Log Event Sequence Window: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E22', 'E5', 'E5', 'E5', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E26', 'E4', 'E3', 'E4', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E21', 'E21']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   Based on the historical data,there are no macth rule. The log sequence is perfectly normal, unless it clearly contains system anomalies.\n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3. Result: Always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim to indicate your final decision.\n\n",

This is a normal operation and does not indicate any anomalies.\n- Log Event E21: This event represents the deletion of a block file. It is normal to have multiple occurrences of this event as blocks are being deleted.\n\nBased on the log events and their descriptions, there are no anomalies detected.

The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E5', 'E5', 'E22', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E26', 'E2', 'E4', 'E3', 'E4', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E21', 'E21']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   Based on the historical data,there are no macth rule. The log sequence is perfectly normal, unless it clearly contains system anomalies.\n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3. Result: Always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim to indicate your final decision.\n\n",

Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific Block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n\n- HDFS Overview: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- Log Templates: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details.

Log Event Sequence Window: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E22', 'E5', 'E5', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E26', 'E4', 'E3', 'E4', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E21', 'E21']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   Based on the historical data,there are no macth rule. The log sequence is perfectly normal, unless it clearly contains system anomalies.\n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3. Result: Always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim to indicate your final decision.\n\n",

Reason: \n\n- Log Event E5: This event indicates that a block is being received from a source and being sent to a destination.

This is a normal operation in the HDFS system.\n- Log Event E11: This event indicates that a PacketResponder for a block is terminating. This is a normal operation in the HDFS system.\n- Log Event E9: This event indicates that a block is being received from a source. This is a normal operation in the HDFS system.\n- Log Event E26: This event indicates that a block is being added to the block map. This is a normal operation in the HDFS system.\n- Log Event E4: This event indicates that an exception occurred while serving a block. This could indicate a potential issue in the system.\n- Log Event E3: This event indicates that a block is being served to a destination. This is a normal operation in the HDFS system.\n- Log Event E23: This event indicates that a block is being deleted and is added to the invalid set. This is a normal operation in the HDFS system.\n- Log Event E21: This event indicates that a block file is being deleted. This is a normal operation in the HDFS system.\n\nBased on the log events and the absence of any triggered rules, the system appears to be in a normal state. The normal operations such as block allocation, block receiving, block serving, and block deletion are all present in the log sequence. Although there is an exception in Log Event E4, it does not indicate a significant anomaly as it is a single occurrence and does not disrupt the normal flow of operations.\n\n3.

Log Event Sequence Window: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E5', 'E5', 'E22', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E26', 'E4', 'E3', 'E4', 'E2', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E21', 'E21']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   Based on the historical data,there are no macth rule. The log sequence is perfectly normal, unless it clearly contains system anomalies.\n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3. Result: Always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim to indicate your final decision.\n\n",

The system received multiple blocks (E5) and allocated a block (E22).\n2. The PacketResponder for a block terminated (E11), which could indicate a failure or abnormal termination.\n3. The system received multiple blocks of different sizes (E9) and added them to the block map (E26).\n4. There was an exception while serving a block (E4) and the block was served (E3).\n5. Verification succeeded for a block (E2).\n6. A block was added to the invalidSet (E23).\n\nAlthough there are no specific anomaly detection rules triggered, I can observe that the log sequence contains a mix of normal system operations and potential issues. The termination of the PacketResponder (E11) and the exception while serving a block (E4) could indicate abnormal behavior. Additionally, the addition of a block to the invalidSet (E23) might suggest a problem with the block.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would classify the system state as [Abnormal]. While there are no explicit rule matches, the presence of potential issues and abnormal behavior in the log sequence suggests that the system may be in an abnormal state.\n\nSystem State: [Abnormal]",

The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E22', 'E5', 'E5', 'E9', 'E26', 'E11', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E4', 'E4', 'E3', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E21', 'E21']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   Based on the historical data,there are no macth rule. The log sequence is perfectly normal, unless it clearly contains system anomalies.\n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3. Result: Always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim to indicate your final decision.\n\n",
        "response": "Based on the provided sequence of log events from the HDFS file system, I will follow the anomaly detection rules to determine if the system is in a normal or abnormal state. If no rules are triggered, I will also analyze the log sequence for any unusual patterns or terms that could indicate potential issues.\n\nNow, let's analyze the log sequence window and evaluate it based on the provided rules:\n\nLog Sequence Window: ['E5', 'E22', 'E5', 'E5', 'E9', 'E26', 'E11', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E4', 'E4', 'E3', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E21', 'E21']\n\n1. Rule Evaluation: Based on the provided rules, there are no matching rules for the log sequence window. Therefore, I will need to analyze the log sequence and its content to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n2. Reasoning: Analyzing the log sequence window, I can observe the following patterns and events:\n\n- E5: Receiving block [*] src:[*] dest:[*]\n- E22: BLOCK* NameSystem[*] allocateBlock:[*]\n- E9: Received block [*] of size [*] from [*]\n- E26: BLOCK* NameSystem[*] addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*] is added to [*] size [*]\n- E11: PacketResponder[*] for block [*] terminating [*]\n- E4: Got exception while serving [*] to [*]\n- E3: Served block [*] to [*]\n- E23: BLOCK* NameSystem[*] delete:[*] is added to invalidSet of [*]\n- E21: Deleting block [*] file [*]\n\nBased on the log sequence and its content, there are no clear indications of errors, failures, or exceptions. The sequence appears to be a normal flow of operations within the HDFS file system. The events indicate the receiving, allocation, and storage of blocks, as well as the serving and deletion of blocks. The termination of a PacketResponder and the addition of a block to the invalidSet are also observed, but these events do not necessarily indicate anomalies.\n\n3. Result: Based on the analysis of the log sequence window and the absence of any triggered rules, I conclude that the system is in a normal state.\n\nSystem State: [Normal]",

The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score.

These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific Block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n\n- HDFS Overview: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- Log Templates: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details.

Log Event Sequence Window: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E22', 'E5', 'E5', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E26', 'E2', 'E2', 'E4', 'E3', 'E4', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E21', 'E21']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   Based on the historical data,there are no macth rule. The log sequence is perfectly normal, unless it clearly contains system anomalies.\n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3.

Log Event Sequence Window: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E5', 'E5', 'E22', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E26', 'E4', 'E4', 'E3', 'E2', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E21', 'E21']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   Based on the historical data,there are no macth rule. The log sequence is perfectly normal, unless it clearly contains system anomalies.\n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3. Result: Always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim to indicate your final decision.\n\n",

Follow the rule or not: I will follow the anomaly detection rules provided.\n\n2. Reason: \n\n- The log sequence starts with multiple occurrences of event E5, which indicates the receiving of a block from a source to a destination. This is a normal operation in the HDFS system.\n- Event E22 indicates the allocation of a block, which is also a normal operation.\n- Event E11, which represents the termination of a PacketResponder for a block, occurs multiple times. This is a normal operation as well.\n- Event E9, which represents the receiving of a block of a specific size from a source, occurs multiple times. This is a normal operation in the HDFS system.\n- Event E26, which represents the addition of a stored block to the block map, occurs multiple times. This is a normal operation.\n- Event E4, which indicates an exception while serving a block to a destination, occurs twice. This could indicate a potential issue, but without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the exception.\n- Event E3, which represents the serving of a block to a destination, occurs once. This is a normal operation.\n- Event E2, which indicates the successful verification of a block, occurs once. This is a normal operation.\n- Events E23 and E21, which represent the deletion of a block, occur multiple times. This is a normal operation.\n\nBased on the log sequence and the absence of any triggered rules, the system appears to be in a normal state. The log events indicate normal operations such as block receiving, allocation, termination, and deletion. The exceptions in events E4 could be investigated further, but without additional information, it is difficult to determine if they indicate a significant issue.\n\n3. Result: System State:[Normal]",

Log Event Sequence Window: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E22', 'E5', 'E5', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E4', 'E4', 'E3', 'E2', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E21', 'E21']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   Based on the historical data,there are no macth rule. The log sequence is perfectly normal, unless it clearly contains system anomalies.\n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3. Result: Always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim to indicate your final decision.\n\n",

This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\nHere is the complete list of log templates used in the system:\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1. Log Event Sequence Window: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. Anomaly Detection Rules: Rules extracted from the training dataset using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Each rule includes criteria for detecting anomalies and a reliability score. If a rule is triggered, it strongly indicates an abnormal system state. However, if no rules are matched, the system is likely to be normal. In that case, you should base your judgment on the log sequence and its content.\n\n### Guidelines for Evaluation:\n\n1. Follow the Rules: Use the extracted rules as your primary guide to detect anomalies. If a rule is matched, the system is likely in an abnormal state.\n2. Additional Evaluation: If no rules are triggered, carefully analyze the log sequence for terms like \"error,\" \"failure,\" \"exception,\" and other unusual patterns. These could indicate potential issues even if no rules are triggered.\n3. Final Decision: After considering both the rules and the log content, make a final decision on whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- Log Sequence Window:\n    ['E5', 'E22', 'E5', 'E5', 'E11', 'E9', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E26', 'E11', 'E9', 'E26', 'E4', 'E4', 'E3', 'E23', 'E23', 'E23', 'E21', 'E21', 'E21']\n- Rules for anomaly detection:\n   Based on the historical data,there are no macth rule. The log sequence is perfectly normal, unless it clearly contains system anomalies.\n  The rules and their evaluation results on the training set are provided here. These serve as a foundation, but you should also consider current feature values and system behaviors to make a comprehensive assessment.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYour response should include three parts:\n\n1. Follow the rule or not: Indicate whether you followed the anomaly detection rules or used your own judgment. Provide your reasoning for the choice.\n2. Reason: Explain the reasoning behind your anomaly detection decision, referencing specific log events or rule triggers.\n3. Result: Always end your response with either 'System State:[Normal]' or 'System State:[Abnormal]' verbatim to indicate your final decision.\n\n",

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific Block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n\n- HDFS Overview: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- Log Events: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- Log Templates: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details.
