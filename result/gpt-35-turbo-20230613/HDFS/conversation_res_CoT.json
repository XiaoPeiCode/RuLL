Anomaly 1: E22 - BLOCK NameSystem allocateBlock\n   This log event indicates that the system is allocating a block. However, there are no corresponding log events (such as E9 or E11) that indicate the successful reception or termination of the block. This suggests that there might be an issue with the block allocation process.\n\n2. Anomaly 2: E4 - Got exception while serving\n   This log event indicates that an exception occurred while serving a block. Exceptions during block serving are not expected in a normal system state and suggest a potential issue with the block serving process.\n\n3. Anomaly 3: E20 - Unexpected error trying to delete block\n   This log event indicates an unexpected error while trying to delete a block. Unexpected errors during block deletion are not normal and suggest a potential issue with the block deletion process.\n\nBased on these anomalies, it can be concluded that the system is in an abnormal state.\n\nSystem State: [Abnormal]",

Anomaly 1: E5 followed by E22\n   The log event E5 indicates the receiving of a block, while E22 indicates the allocation of a block. It is unusual to allocate a block before receiving it. This suggests a potential anomaly in the system.\n\n2. Anomaly 2: E9 followed by E11\n   The log event E9 indicates the receiving of a block, while E11 indicates the termination of a PacketResponder for the same block. It is unusual for a PacketResponder to terminate immediately after receiving a block. This suggests a potential anomaly in the system.\n\n3. Anomaly 3: E11 followed by E26\n   The log event E11 indicates the termination of a PacketResponder, while E26 indicates the addition of a stored block. It is unusual for a stored block to be added immediately after a PacketResponder termination. This suggests a potential anomaly in the system.\n\n4. Anomaly 4: E26 followed by E9\n   The log event E26 indicates the addition of a stored block, while E9 indicates the receiving of a block. It is unusual for a stored block to be added before receiving it. This suggests a potential anomaly in the system.\n\n5. Anomaly 5: E4\n   The log event E4 indicates an exception while serving a block. Exceptions are typically unexpected and indicate abnormal behavior in the system.\n\n6. Anomaly 6: E20\n   The log event E20 indicates an unexpected error while trying to delete a block. Unexpected errors are typically abnormal and indicate a problem in the system.\n\nBased on these anomalies, it can be concluded that the system is in an abnormal state.\n\nSystem State: [Abnormal]",

It is unusual to have multiple consecutive E9 log events following an E11 log event without any other log events in between. This suggests a potential issue with the block receiving process after the termination of a PacketResponder.\n   \n3.

This suggests a potential issue with the block receiving process after updating the blockMap.\n   \n4.
