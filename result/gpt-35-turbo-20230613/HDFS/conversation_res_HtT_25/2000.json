        "user": "You are a log-based software system anomaly detection assistant, and you need to determine if there is an anomaly based on a sequence of logs that I give you while the system is running.\n\nYou are a log-based software system anomaly detection assistant specialized in analyzing Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) logs. Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state. A short sequence may suggest that the block lifecycle did not complete as expected.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\n**Here is the complete list of log templates used in the system:**\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1. **Log Event Sequence Window**: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state. A short sequence may suggest that the block lifecycle did not complete as expected.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details.

        "user": "You are a log-based software system anomaly detection assistant, and you need to determine if there is an anomaly based on a sequence of logs that I give you while the system is running.\n\nYou are a log-based software system anomaly detection assistant specialized in analyzing Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) logs. Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state. A short sequence may suggest that the block lifecycle did not complete as expected.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details.

In this case, the block is received before it is allocated, which is not part of the normal lifecycle.\n\n- The log sequence window does not contain the pattern E23 followed by E21, which is mentioned in one of the rules. According to the rule, this pattern indicates a normal state. Since this pattern is not present, it does not contribute to the determination of the system state.\n\n- The log sequence window contains the pattern E4 followed by E3, which is mentioned in one of the rules. According to the rule, this pattern indicates an abnormal state. An exception occurred while serving, which is not part of the normal lifecycle.\n\n- The log sequence window does not contain the pattern E28, which is mentioned in one of the rules.

        "user": "You are a log-based software system anomaly detection assistant, and you need to determine if there is an anomaly based on a sequence of logs that I give you while the system is running.\n\nYou are a log-based software system anomaly detection assistant specialized in analyzing Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) logs. Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state. A short sequence may suggest that the block lifecycle did not complete as expected.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\n**Here is the complete list of log templates used in the system:**\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1. **Log Event Sequence Window**: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block. The sequence is generated from a parsed version of the logs, where each event corresponds to a log template ID.\n2. **Rules for Anomaly Detection**: Rules extracted from the training dataset.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state. A short sequence may suggest that the block lifecycle did not complete as expected.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\n**Here is the complete list of log templates used in the system:**\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1. **Log Event Sequence Window**: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state. A short sequence may suggest that the block lifecycle did not complete as expected.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details.

This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\n**Here is the complete list of log templates used in the system:**\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1. **Log Event Sequence Window**: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state. A short sequence may suggest that the block lifecycle did not complete as expected.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state. A short sequence may suggest that the block lifecycle did not complete as expected.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\n**Here is the complete list of log templates used in the system:**\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1. **Log Event Sequence Window**: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system.

It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies.

These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state. A short sequence may suggest that the block lifecycle did not complete as expected.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\n**Here is the complete list of log templates used in the system:**\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1. **Log Event Sequence Window**: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state. A short sequence may suggest that the block lifecycle did not complete as expected.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state. A short sequence may suggest that the block lifecycle did not complete as expected.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\n**Here is the complete list of log templates used in the system:**\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1. **Log Event Sequence Window**: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state. A short sequence may suggest that the block lifecycle did not complete as expected.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\n**Here is the complete list of log templates used in the system:**\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1. **Log Event Sequence Window**: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state. A short sequence may suggest that the block lifecycle did not complete as expected.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details.

Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state. A short sequence may suggest that the block lifecycle did not complete as expected.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\n**Here is the complete list of log templates used in the system:**\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1. **Log Event Sequence Window**: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block.

        "user": "You are a log-based software system anomaly detection assistant, and you need to determine if there is an anomaly based on a sequence of logs that I give you while the system is running.\n\nYou are a log-based software system anomaly detection assistant specialized in analyzing Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) logs. Your task is to determine whether the system is in a [Normal] or [Abnormal] state based on the provided sequence of log events from a specific block in the HDFS file system. Additionally, you should provide a written description of your reasoning for the classification.\n\n## Background Information\n- **HDFS Overview**: HDFS is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets and is highly fault-tolerant.\n- **Log Events**: Each log event corresponds to specific operations or states within the HDFS system. Understanding the sequence and content of these events is crucial for identifying anomalies. A log template represents a general structure of a log event.\n- **Log Templates**: Logs generated by HDFS often contain unstructured data. To make logs easier to analyze, similar log entries are grouped into predefined formats called *log templates*. These templates abstract variable parts (e.g., block IDs, file sizes) and help focus on system operations and patterns. For example, a specific log like \"Received block block1234 of size 5678 from source IP\" would be simplified into a template like \"Received block [*] of size [*] from [*].\"\n- **Block Lifecycle in HDFS**: A typical block in HDFS goes through several operations in a defined sequence. The key stages include:\n    - **Block Allocation**: The system allocates a block (e.g., E22) to store data.\n    - **Block Reception**: The block is received from a source (e.g., E5, E9).\n    - **Replication**: The block is replicated to ensure fault tolerance (e.g., E12, E10).\n    - **Serving/Reading the Block**: The block is served to clients upon request (e.g., E3).\n    - **Block Removal or Deletion**: Once no longer needed, the block is marked for deletion or removed (e.g., E6, E7).\n    - If key steps within the normal operational flow are missing, it could indicate an abnormal state. A short sequence may suggest that the block lifecycle did not complete as expected.\n\n### Purpose of Log Templates:\nBy converting raw log data into templates, we can focus on system behaviors without being distracted by variable details. This helps efficiently identify patterns and detect anomalies.\n\n**Here is the complete list of log templates used in the system:**\n\n- E1: [*]Adding an already existing block[*]\n- E2: [*]Verification succeeded for[*]\n- E3: [*]Served block[*]to[*]\n- E4: [*]Got exception while serving[*]to[*]\n- E5: [*]Receiving block[*]src:[*]dest:[*]\n- E6: [*]Deleting block[*]\n- E7: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Removing block[*]\n- E8: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Added block[*]\n- E9: [*]Received block[*]of size[*]from[*]\n- E10: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Completed replication[*]\n- E11: [*]PacketResponder[*]for block[*]terminating[*]\n- E12: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Starting replication[*]\n- E13: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Marking block[*]\n- E14: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication of block[*]failed[*]\n- E15: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Failed to remove block[*]\n- E16: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]All replicas for block[*]are removed[*]\n- E17: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Received IBR for[*]\n- E18: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Replication factor for block[*]is set to[*]\n- E19: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Registered replica of[*]\n- E20: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]Checking replication[*]\n- E21: [*]Deleting block[*]file[*]\n- E22: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]allocateBlock:[*]\n- E23: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]is added to invalidSet of[*]\n- E24: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]delete:[*]completed[*]\n- E25: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]BlockReport completed[*]\n- E26: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: blockMap updated:[*]is added to[*]size[*]\n- E27: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]\n- E28: [*]BLOCK* NameSystem[*]addStoredBlock: addStoredBlock request received for[*]on[*]size[*]But it does not belong to any file[*]\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be provided with:\n\n1. **Log Event Sequence Window**: A chronological list of log event IDs representing a complete sequence of operations performed by the system within an HDFS block.
